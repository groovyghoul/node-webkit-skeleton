node-webkit-skeleton
====================

Starting point for my node-webkit projects

To get started, from the root type the following commands:

`npm install` - this will install the node modules, including node-webkit (which may take a minute or so to download).

`grunt` - this is the build command. You will find your executables in the `dist` folder.

Adjust the `package.json` file to change the OS-target.
